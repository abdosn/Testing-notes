# Introduction

Unit test is used to test specific module/driver/Software component by isolating it from other mdoules

This effective to test the algorithm of your modules individually without running your whole code 


## How to do unit test ?

By writing Test cases to your module to achieve all possible inputs to the functions and all scenarios

Also by make sure that all your code regions is tested like 
if-elseif-else - To make sure thatthe code enters statement according to the condition-

Test that for a given input the expected output returns

example: 
for a given function that is sorting an array elements

test that if array numbers is negative or zeros
test for duplicated elements
test what happened when if an input is outside the range (it's handeled or not) 
Also you need to test exeptions if it's happened what to do
